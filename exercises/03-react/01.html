1. Design the component tree for a todo list application. This application maintains a list of things to do (task list), with indication if a task is completed or not. Each task has a checkbox against it to mark if it has been completed or not, and a button to delete the task from the list. On top of the task list is an input to accept the name of a new task to be added to the list. Below the input is a button that the user clicks after entering the task name in the input. Once the user clicks the button, the task is added to the task list.

<TodoList>
    <TaskInput message="What do you want to do?" buttonText="Add" />
    <TaskList tasks={ [ { name: 'Learn React', completed: true }, { name: 'Go on vacation', completed: false } ] } />
</TodoList>
